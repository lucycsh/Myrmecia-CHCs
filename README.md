# The evolution of cuticular hydrocarbon diversity in *Myrmecia* ant species
### Abstract
Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are one of the primary chemical cues in insects and play a essential role in nest-mate recognition in ants. However, while knowledge of the diversity and composition of CHC profiles in ants has significantly expanded, there is still little understanding on how patterns of chemical evolution have shaped CHC diversity between closely-related species (i.e. within a single genus). Unresolved questions include the extent to which such species have unique CHC profiles, and whether diversity has arisen through gradual accumulation of differences in chemical composition over evolutionary time, or through larger shifts in composition at speciation events. We investigated cuticular hydrocarbon diversity within the endemic Australian genus Myrmecia (bull ants),  examining the relationship of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles to phylogeny, and for one species (Myrmecia pilosula) the variation and relationship of CHC profile to geographic proximity.
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to quantify CHC composition from 245 individual ants across 43 nests and 17 Myrmecia species. Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) was used quantify the relative amounts of variation between species and within species. Principal Components Analysis was used to identify differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles between species. Finally, Mantel tests were used to determine the relationships between phylogenetic distance and cuticular hydrocarbon profiles between species, and geographical distances and cuticular hydrocarbon profiles within M. pilosula. The PERMANOVA revealed that inter-species variation was over 30 times greater than intra-species variation, suggesting that CHCs are distinct and highly conserved within species, indicative of their potential role in inter-species recognition. A significant positive correlation was found between phylogenetic distance, and CHC profile chemical distances between species, suggesting that more closely related species have more similar cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, indicating a gradual mode of evolution following initial diversification between species. However, variation between nests with M. pilosula was also found to be significant, with each nest having its own unique cuticular hydrocarbon profile, suggesting that broader chemical profile differences can be found to originate even prior to species divergence. A weak (p = 0.07) positive trend was also observed between geographical distance and cuticular hydrocarbon profile distances between nest in M. pilosula, suggesting that differences may originate based on geographic separation or environmental cues.
